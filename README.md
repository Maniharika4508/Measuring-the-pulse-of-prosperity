# Measuring-the-pulse-of-prosperity
Measuring the pulse of prosperity means evaluating a country’s economic and social well-being through key indicators like GDP, employment, inflation, and quality of life. It helps understand whether growth is stable, inclusive, and sustainable. True prosperity goes beyond income — it includes opportunity, equality, and long-term development.
